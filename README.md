This is an incredibly small and simple Swift wrapper for the `keystone-engine` project.

The project is absurdly out of date and can't really even be compiled from source.

So, for everyone's convenience, this project contains a built-in `libkeystone.xcframework` that will work for arm64 or x86_64.

If anything is fucked up, don't hesitate to add an Issue or send me a message.
